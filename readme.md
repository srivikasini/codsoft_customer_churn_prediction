## Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) using machine learning techniques.
The model is trained to classify customers as churned or retained based on customer details.

## Tools Used

1.Python
2.Pandas
3.NumPy
4.Scikit-learn

## Dataset

Dataset taken from Kaggle:
Churn Modelling Dataset

## Project Workflow

1.Data loading and exploration
2.Data preprocessing
3.Encoding categorical variables
4.Train–test data split
5.Model training
6.Model evaluation

## Model

Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics

1.Accuracy
2.Precision
3.Recall
4.Confusion Matrix

## Result

The trained model successfully predicts customer churn with good accuracy and helps in identifying customers who are likely to leave the company.

## Internship
